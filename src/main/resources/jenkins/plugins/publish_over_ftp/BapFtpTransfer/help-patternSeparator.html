<div>
    <p>The regular expression that is used to separate the <tt>Source files</tt> and <tt>Exclude files</tt> patterns.</p>
    <p>The <tt>Source files</tt> and <tt>Exclude files</tt> both accept multiple patterns that by default are split using <pre>[, ]+</pre>
    which is how Ant, by default, handles multiple patterns in a single string.
    </p>
    <p>The above expression makes it difficult to reference files or directories that contain spaces. This option allows
        the expression to be set to something that will preserve the spaces in a pattern eg. a single comma.
    </p>
